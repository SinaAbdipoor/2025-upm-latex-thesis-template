% TODO: Define all your abbreviations here, as shown below. When writing your thesis, you can use them with the "\ac{}" command. For example: "I don't know why I decided to study at \ac{UPM}." LaTeX will automatically use the long version the first time and the short version thereafter. Additionally, all your abbreviations will be included in the table of abbreviations.
\DeclareAcronym{upm}{
  short=UPM,
  long=Universiti Putra Malaysia,
}
