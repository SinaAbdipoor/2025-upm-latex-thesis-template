% TODO: Write all your appendices here. Before removing the text below, read it to determine if and when you need an appendix. You can write here just as you would in the thesis.tex file, using \chapter, \section, references, etc. If you do not need an appendix in your thesis, go to main.tex and place a "%" before "\include{appendix}".
\chapter{APPENDICES}
Information or data that is too detailed for the main body of the thesis may be included as appendices. Appendices include original data, summary, sideline or preliminary tests, tabulations, tables that contain data of lesser importance, very lengthy quotations, supporting decisions, forms and documents, computer printouts, detailed engineering drawings and other pertinent documents. Appendix materials should be grouped by type, e.g., Appendix A: Questionnaire, Appendix B: Original data, Appendix C: Tables of results.
