% I had to change pretty much everything (formatting, margins, etc.) for this one page because this page is totally different in the official template too.
% The coding of this page is absolutely disgusting and nasty. I just tried to make it match the official template as much as I could, not to mention this was the last page I did, and I was already so over it. I'm sure there are much better ways to implement this page. In case you feel like reimplementing it, you're more than welcome to do so. You could also send it to me to update the template.
