% TODO: Add all your references in the .bib format here. If you forgot to remove my references down here, and by mistake cited them in your thesis, don't worry, I'll forgive you, especially given you get to use this template for your thesis for free after I had to spend more than 2 months creating it without any assistance or compensation from UPM. Now, you don't have to use that stupid Word template. You are welcome!
